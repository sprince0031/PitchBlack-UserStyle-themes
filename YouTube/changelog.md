# Changelog:

### v2.1
- Fixed live badge theming inconsistency on thumbnails and in video meta content.
- Themed live dot on the video player controls section to the accent colour.

## v2.0 
### NEW TRANSPARENCY MODE!
Visiting my theme to fix the bugs after years got me thinking about how I could enhance it a bit. Make it a bit more interesting. So here we are! The transparency mode themes a lot of the UI elements with a translucent frosted glass effect. UI elements that have gotten this effect are as follows:

- Top bar 
- Search suggestions box 
- Mini player's info bar 
- Voice search pop-up box

Apart from these almost all pop boxes and menus have the effect but these are not yet tinted according to the selected background colour. I'm having a hard time figuring out how to tint all such UI elements uniformly, but they look kind of cool in it's current state as well I felt. A bit of a lighter contrast to my pitch black preference. :) Also, I have ported this theme to userstyles.world . I will be maintaining this theme there from now on.

## v1.0
I had initially created this theme for myself. Hence when I started seeing those pesky white boxes after YouTube significantly changed their UI, I just had to update this again. Reading the comments was extra motivation. I have themed most of the visible and used UI elements trying to keep the accent colouring consistent. You should not be seeing any of the white boxes anymore once you've updated the theme. Keep in mind to remove the theme and re-apply it after selecting your preferred colour combination. Directly updating it will result in the default red and black colours being applied. If there are any more bugs or inconsistencies, let me know in the comments and I will try my best to fix them. Cheers!
