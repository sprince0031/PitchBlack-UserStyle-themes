# PitchBlack themes for the web.
  
Inspired by the legendary PitchBlack Substratum theme for Android (back when good dark themes din't really exist natively), this is a PitchBlack theme for YouTube. In true PitchBlack fashion, you get to pick the accent color of your choice! A list of all PitchBlack accents and background variants are available below along with their hexcodes. Do note that you can pick any color you want from the color picker but these are the official colors. Enjoy!
  
                               Accent colors:              |            Background colors:

### Issues with the theme

I try to keep the themes free from any glaring UI bugs. My motivation always has been to create a theme I myself can enjoy using every day. However, if you find any issues in the UI, kindly open a new issue in this repository. You can send an email to siddharthprince31@gmail.com as well. I will try to get it fixed as soon as possible.
