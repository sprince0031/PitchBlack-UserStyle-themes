# PitchBlack themes for the web.

![Recreation of the original screenshot for the first version of the YouTube theme uploaded in September 2018](https://github.com/sprince0031/PitchBlack-UserStyle-themes/raw/master/YouTube/screenshots/PitchBlack_ForOldTimes_ReadmeSS.png)
  
Inspired by the legendary PitchBlack Substratum theme for Android (back when good dark themes din't really exist natively), this is a PitchBlack theme for YouTube. In true PitchBlack fashion, you get to pick the accent colour of your choice! A list of all PitchBlack accents and background variants are available [below](https://github.com/sprince0031/PitchBlack-UserStyle-themes/blob/master/README.md#theme-colour-codes) along with their hexcodes. Do note that you can pick any colour you want from the colour picker but these are the official colours. Enjoy!  

## Theme Colour Codes

Choose one [accent colour](https://github.com/sprince0031/PitchBlack-UserStyle-themes/blob/master/README.md#accent-colours) and one [background colour](https://github.com/sprince0031/PitchBlack-UserStyle-themes/blob/master/README.md#background-colours) from the codes below to get a theme! You can copy and paste these codes in the respective fields in the Stylus colour picker.

### Issues with the theme

I try to keep the themes free from any glaring UI bugs. My motivation always has been to create a theme I myself can enjoy using every day. However, if you find any issues in the UI, kindly open a new issue in this repository. You can send an email to siddharthprince31@gmail.com as well. I will try to get it fixed as soon as possible.
